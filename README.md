## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is independent and can be run separately:

```bash
# Navigate to a project
cd project-name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Notes

- Each project is in its own subfolder
- All projects use React + TypeScript + Vite
- Check individual project READMEs for detailed documentation
- Screenshots and project details are in each project's folder
